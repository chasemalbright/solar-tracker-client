Background
This summer, ERCOT has gotten up to 17% of its daily power from solar. Sudden and drastic weather changes can significantly impact solar output and as a result, have an impact on power prices. Having real time solar production data for ERCOT’s largest solar producers will allow power traders to validate weather models and instantly know solar performance in order to achieve an edge in the market.

TLDR: Real time solar data can be used to quickly assess changes in power prices.

Presentation Content
Discuss and provide data on how fluctuations in solar power output due to weather impact prices

Discuss how real time solar data can be used as a way to validate weather models and know instantly how solar is performing across the grid.
Show how this data can be used by traders to make trading decisions
Transition “so you might be wondering where this real time data will come from…”
